2025-01-20 to 24: [School on Disordered Media](https://erdoscenter.renyi.hu/events/school-disordered-media "The School on Disordered Media explores stochastic processes in disordered systems. Key topics include random walks in random environments, percolation theory, and spin glasses. The event covers statistical mechanics, probability theory, and applications in condensed matter physics, emphasizing mathematical models for complex, heterogeneous media."), Budapest, Hungary.

2025-01-27 to 31: [Workshop on Disordered Media (2025)](https://erdoscenter.renyi.hu/events/workshop-disordered-media "This workshop examines disordered media through stochastic models. Topics include random media transport, localization phenomena, and disordered spin systems. It explores mathematical frameworks like percolation and random matrix theory, with applications in statistical physics, materials science, and complex systems analysis."), Budapest, Hungary.
